                    I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence and software engineering. In my recent
                    works, I explored the application of weighted loss functions and a novel weighted fuzzy
                    oversampling scheme to achieve state-of-the-art results using deep learning.

                    I worked on the application of neural text processing systems to medical science; specifically,
                    I applied a language model to perform text mining to identify potential novel cures for rare
                    diseases.
