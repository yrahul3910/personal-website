                    Not quite satisfied with the flexibility of existing resume solutions, I developed a syntax for modular resumes that are far more customizable and allow
                    for generating multiple CVs in parallel. My CVs above are generated using this syntax.

                    While learning web development at FreeCodeCamp, I developed several small projects using the MERN stack, including a URL shortener, a voting application, a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, a Simon game, and several visualization projects using D3.js

                    This is a fun side project I worked on. For around 10 months, I collected data on every single activity I do, with a total of 30 activity categories. I then used this data to analyze my most productive hours and built a 2-layer LSTM to predict my next activity based on the previous five.
