                    A math application that got over 20K downloads, with calculus and advanced functions and an easy-to-use interface. This was my first software, developed using VB.NET--which I still strongly believe is an excellent beginner language.

                    While learning web development at FreeCodeCamp, I developed several small projects using the MERN stack, including a URL shortener, a voting application, a rogue-like dungeon crawler game, a Simon game, and several visualization projects using D3.js

                    This is a fun side project I worked on. For around 10 months, I collected data on every single activity I do, with a total of 30 activity categories. I then used this data to analyze my most productive hours and built a 2-layer LSTM to predict my next activity based on the previous five.

                    A blog to teach machine learning to beginners in a way I believe that I would have found helpful when I had started, making sure it has the mathematical rigor, but also an intuitive explanation, and Python code.
